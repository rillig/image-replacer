Minimalistic GUI for search and replace inside an image.

It's a quick prototype, so all action is done in the UI thread.

On the left side is the original screenshot.
The image on the right side is the edited screenshot,
in which all occurrences of ![](./images/wheel.png) have been replaced with ![](./images/pink.png):

![](./images/screenshot%20before.png) &nbsp; ![](./images/screenshot%20after.png)

Possible use cases:
* Swapping the avatars of people involved in screenshots from social media conversations (useful for "journalists" creating fake news).
* In software documentation, replacing icons from an old icon theme with a new icon theme.
